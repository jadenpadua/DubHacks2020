        'Bali Blue Moon has the same spicy, complex notes and backbone as Sumatra, just a bit finer. With less of the earthy, herbal punch, it starts and ends with smooth. Weighty in the cup, with dark chocolate and caramel notes and a syrupy body, itâ€™s a great complement to blustery weather, an ideal mug to cradle in your hands as the weather starts to turn.'
